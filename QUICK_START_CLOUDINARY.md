# 🚀 Cloudinary Integration - Quick Start Guide

## ⚡ 1-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Environment Variable (Already Done!)
Your Cloudinary URL is already configured:
```env
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://424474367888639:-QUb0qiBjtIFW5FNTQ5iWy2NLGQ@dkt88mf2n
```

This is already in your backend `.env` file! ✅

### Step 2: Test Integration
```bash
cd backend
npm run test:cloudinary
```

This will verify Cloudinary is working and upload test images.

### Step 3: Start Scraping!
```bash
# Start backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# In another terminal, scrape a user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/users/validate/cristiano
```

**That's it!** All media will automatically upload to Cloudinary! 🎉

## 🎯 What Happens Now?

### During Scraping:

1. **Profile Picture** 
   - Instagram URL fetched
   - Uploaded to Cloudinary: `instagram/profiles/{username}/`
   - Cloudinary URL saved to database

2. **Post Images**
   - Instagram URL fetched
   - Uploaded to Cloudinary: `instagram/posts/{username}/`
   - Cloudinary URL saved to database

3. **Videos**
   - Instagram URL fetched
   - Uploaded to Cloudinary: `instagram/posts/{username}/` or `instagram/reels/{username}/`
   - Cloudinary URL saved to database

4. **Thumbnails**
   - Instagram URL fetched
   - Uploaded to Cloudinary: `instagram/reels/{username}/`
   - Cloudinary URL saved to database

### In Your Database:

All URL fields now contain Cloudinary URLs:
```javascript
{
  "profile_picture_url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dkt88mf2n/image/upload/.../profile_picture.jpg",
  "image_url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dkt88mf2n/image/upload/.../post_id.jpg",
  "video_url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dkt88mf2n/video/upload/.../post_id_video.mp4"
}
```

## 📊 View Your Media

### Cloudinary Console
Visit: https://cloudinary.com/console/media_library

Login with your Cloudinary credentials and you'll see:
```
📁 instagram/
  📁 profiles/
    📁 cristiano/
      🖼️ profile_picture.jpg
  📁 posts/
    📁 cristiano/
      🖼️ post_123.jpg
      🎥 post_123_video.mp4
  📁 reels/
    📁 cristiano/
      🖼️ reel_456_thumbnail.jpg
      🎥 reel_456_video.mp4
```

## ✅ Verify It's Working

### 1. Check Logs
```bash
cd backend
tail -f logs/combined.log
```

Look for:
```
INFO: Uploading profile picture to Cloudinary for @username
INFO: Successfully uploaded to Cloudinary: https://res.cloudinary.com/...
INFO: Uploading 12 posts media to Cloudinary for @username
INFO: Saved 12 raw post rows for @username with Cloudinary URLs
```

### 2. Check Database
```javascript
// MongoDB query
db.profiles.findOne({ username: "cristiano" })

// Should show:
{
  "profile_picture_url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dkt88mf2n/...",
  // ... other fields
}
```

### 3. Check API Response
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/users/profile/cristiano
```

Response will have Cloudinary URLs:
```json
{
  "profile": {
    "profile_picture_url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dkt88mf2n/..."
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Test Fails
```bash
npm run test:cloudinary
```

**If you see errors:**

1. **"Cloudinary configuration missing"**
   - Check `.env` file exists in `backend/` directory
   - Verify `CLOUDINARY_URL` is set

2. **"401 Unauthorized"**
   - Verify Cloudinary URL is correct
   - Check account is active at cloudinary.com

3. **"Network error"**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify Cloudinary service status

### Media Not Uploading

**Check:**
1. Backend logs: `backend/logs/combined.log`
2. Cloudinary console: https://cloudinary.com/console
3. Environment variable: `echo $CLOUDINARY_URL`

**Common fixes:**
- Restart backend server
- Clear logs and retry
- Test with `npm run test:cloudinary`
